# FileToImage

## Purpose

Takes a file (specified in its arguments or upon request) and creates an image from pixel data based on the bytes read from that file.

## Usage

From a command line:
java -jar (folder path)FileToImage.jar (file path and name)

## Why?
Fun, mostly.

## To do (read: things I could toss in to improve this thing a little)

*Allow user control of image file output (such as format, name etc.)
*Make the input itself not rubbish
*Write better Javadoc. Seriously, does any of that crud even make sense to anyone?
*A billion other things, probably.
